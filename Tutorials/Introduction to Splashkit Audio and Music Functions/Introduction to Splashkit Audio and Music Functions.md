title: Introduction to Music Functions in SplashKit
---

## Introduction

This tutorial aims to equip you with the skills necessary to enhance your games or applications with immersive audio experiences. We'll explore a variety of functions for loading, playing, and manipulating music tracks in SplashKit.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts.
- Proficiency in C++.
- A configured IDE for C++ development, like Visual Studio Code.
- SplashKit framework installed. Refer to the [SplashKit installation guide](https://splashkit.io/installation/).

## Example: Playing and Controlling Music

Let's start with a complete example that demonstrates how to load, play, pause, resume, and control the volume of music in SplashKit.

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

// Function to manage music playback
void manage_music()
{
    // Load background music
    music background_music = load_music("background", "path/to/background.mp3");

    // Play the background music continuously
    play_music(background_music, -1, 0.5); // -1 for looping indefinitely, volume set to 50%

    bool is_music_paused = false; // Track whether the music is paused
    float music_volume = 0.5; // Track the current volume level

    // Main loop
    while (!window_close_requested("Music Example"))
    {
        process_events();

        if (key_typed(SPACE_KEY))
        {
            // Pause or resume the music when space is pressed
            if (is_music_paused)
            {
                resume_music();
                is_music_paused = false;
            }
            else
            {
                pause_music();
                is_music_paused = true;
            }
        }

        if (key_typed(UP_KEY))
        {
            // Increase volume
            music_volume += 0.1;
            if (music_volume > 1.0)
            {
                music_volume = 1.0;
            }
            set_music_volume(music_volume);
        }

        if (key_typed(DOWN_KEY))
        {
            // Decrease volume
            music_volume -= 0.1;
            if (music_volume < 0.0)
            {
                music_volume = 0.0;
            }
            set_music_volume(music_volume);
        }

        delay(100);  // Brief delay to avoid spamming input
    }

    // Stop and free the music resource before exiting
    stop_music();
    free_music(background_music);
}

// Main function
int main()
{
    open_window("Music Example", 800, 600);

    // Ensure the audio system is ready
    if (!audio_ready())
    {
        open_audio();
    }

    // Call the function to manage music
    manage_music();

    // Close the audio system
    close_audio();

    return 0;
}
```

## Breaking Down

### Ensuring Audio System Readiness

Before attempting to play audio, check the system's readiness with the `audio_ready` function. If the audio system is not ready, you should open it using `open_audio`.

```cpp
if (!audio_ready())
{
    open_audio();
}
```

### Loading and Playing Music

First, we load the background music using the load_music function. This ensures that the audio resource is available when needed.

```cpp
music background_music = load_music("background", "path/to/background.mp3");
```

Next, we play the background music continuously using the `play_music` function.

```cpp
play_music(background_music, -1, 0.5); // -1 for looping indefinitely, volume set to 50%
```

### Main Loop

The main loop runs until the window is closed. Inside this loop, we process events and check if specific keys are pressed to control the music playback and volume.

```cpp
bool is_music_paused = false; // Track whether the music is paused
float music_volume = 0.5; // Track the current volume level

while (!window_close_requested("Music Example"))
{
    process_events();

    if (key_typed(SPACE_KEY))
    {
        // Pause or resume the music when space is pressed
        if (is_music_paused)
        {
            resume_music();
            is_music_paused = false;
        }
        else
        {
            pause_music();
            is_music_paused = true;
        }
    }

    if (key_typed(UP_KEY))
    {
        // Increase volume
        music_volume += 0.1;
        if (music_volume > 1.0)
        {
            music_volume = 1.0;
        }
        set_music_volume(music_volume);
    }

    if (key_typed(DOWN_KEY))
    {
        // Decrease volume
        music_volume -= 0.1;
        if (music_volume < 0.0)
        {
            music_volume = 0.0;
        }
        set_music_volume(music_volume);
    }

    delay(100);  // Brief delay to avoid spamming input
}
```

- `process_events()` handles any pending events (e.g., keyboard input, window close requests).
- `key_typed(KEY)` checks if a specific key was pressed.
- `pause_music()` pauses the currently playing music.
- `resume_music()` resumes the paused music.
- `set_music_volume(volume)` sets the volume of the currently playing music.
- `delay(milliseconds)` adds a brief delay to avoid spamming input.

### Stopping and Freeing Music

After exiting the main loop (when the window is closed), we stop the music and free the music resource to clean up.

```cpp
stop_music();
free_music(background_music);
```

### Main Function

The `main` function sets up the window, ensures the audio system is ready, calls the `manage_music` function to execute the music management logic, and finally closes the audio system.

```cpp
int main()
{
    open_window("Music Example", 800, 600);

    // Ensure the audio system is ready
    if (!audio_ready())
    {
        open_audio();
    }

    // Call the function to manage music
    manage_music();

    // Close the audio system
    close_audio();

    return 0;
}
```
