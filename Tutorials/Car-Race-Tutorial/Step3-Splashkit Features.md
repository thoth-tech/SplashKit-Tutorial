## Introduction

Welcome to the SplashKit Library Features tutorial. In this tutorial, we'll dive into the features offered by the SplashKit library, a powerful toolkit for game development in C++. We'll cover sprite creation, drawing, animation, bitmap loading, manipulation, sound effect loading, and playback.

## Sprite Creation, Drawing, and Animation

1. **Sprite Creation**:
   - Sprites are movable and animated images used to represent game objects.
   - Here we created the sprite to change the color of car skin
   - Create a sprite from a bitmap:

     ```cpp
     void switch_car_skin(car_data &car)
     {
     bitmap other = car_bitmap(YELLOW);
     bitmap_set_cell_details(other, 75, 120, 3, 1, 3);
     sprite_add_layer(car.car_sprite, other, "YELLOW");
     sprite_hide_layer(car.car_sprite, 1);

     if (car.model == RED)
     {
        car.model = YELLOW;
        sprite_hide_layer(car.car_sprite, 0);
        sprite_show_layer(car.car_sprite, 1);
     }
     else if (car.model == YELLOW)
     {
        car.model = RED;
        sprite_hide_layer(car.car_sprite, 1);
        sprite_show_layer(car.car_sprite, 0);
     }
     }
     ```

2. **Drawing Sprites**:
   - Draw a sprite on the screen:
     ```cpp
     // Function to draw the car
     void draw_car(car_data &car)
     {
     draw_sprite(car.car_sprite);
     }
     ```

3. **Animation**:
   - Animate a sprite by changing its position, rotation, and image frame over time:
   - While creating new car we declared the animation of the car
     ```cpp
     animation_script carAnimation = load_animation_script("carAnimation", "carAnimation.txt");
     ```

## Bitmap Loading and Manipulation

1. **Bitmap Loading**:
   - Load bitmap images from files:
     ```cpp
     // Used on many occassions
     draw_bitmap("game", 0, 0, option_to_screen()); // used while drawing the game
     bitmap default_bitmap = car_bitmap(model); // getting the car image
     ```

2. **Bitmap Manipulation**:
   - Modify bitmap properties such as size, color, and transparency:
     ```cpp
       bitmap_set_cell_details(default_bitmap, 75, 120, 3, 1, 3); // setting the car position
     ```
