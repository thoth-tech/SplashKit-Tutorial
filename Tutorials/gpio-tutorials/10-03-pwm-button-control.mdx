In this tutorial, we bring all the previous lessons together. We are reading button presses and will use these readings to modify the brightness of an LED by changing the PWM duty cycle. This tutorial brings together digital pin reading, writing and PWM modification. This is a simple demonstration of how to integrate various physical components and get them working with each other.

### Components

See [Blink LED Tutorial](/guides/gpio/10-00-blink-led/#components) for more details on these components.

- Breadboard
- LED
- 220 Ω Resistor
- Jumper Wires

See [Read Button Press Tutorial](/guides/gpio/10-01-read-button-press/#components) for more details on these components:

- 2 Push Buttons

### The Circuit

Below we can see the circuit diagram for this project. First we have the Raspberry Pi ground connected to the ground rail of the breadboard and a 3.3V pin connected to the power rail of the bread board. We then have an LED which is connected to the ground rail and to Pin 11 through a 220 Ω  resistor. We then have 2 buttons, where both are connected to the powered rail on the breadboard and the otherside of the buttons are connected to pins 13 and 29.

### The Code

:::caution[Before running the code.]
This code requires the `pigpio` daemon, so make sure it is running! For more information see: [Starting the Daemon](/guides/gpio/10-00-blink-led/#starting-the-daemon)
:::

Below is an example program to that will detect button presses to increase or decrease the brightness of an LED.

    ``` cpp
    #include <splashkit.h>

    int main()
    {
        int brightness = 128;
        const int max_brightness = 255;
        unsigned long last_read_time = 0;
        const unsigned long read_interval = 400;

        raspi_init();
        pins led_pin = PIN_11;
        pins increase_btn_pin = PIN_13;
        pins decrease_btn_pin = PIN_29;

        raspi_set_mode(led_pin, GPIO_OUTPUT);
        raspi_set_pwm_dutycycle(led_pin, brightness);

        raspi_set_mode(increase_btn_pin, GPIO_INPUT);
        raspi_set_mode(decrease_btn_pin, GPIO_INPUT);

        raspi_set_pull_up_down(increase_button_pin, PUD_DOWN);
        raspi_set_pull_up_down(decrease_btn_pin, PUD_DOWN);

        timer run_timer = create_timer("run_timer");
        start_timer(run_timer);
        unsigned long current_time = 0;

        open_window("dummy_window", 1, 1);
        while(!any_key_pressed())
        {
            process_events();
            current_time = timer_ticks(run_timer);
            if(current_time - last_read_time > read_interval)
            {
                if(raspi_read(increase_btn_pin) == GPIO_HIGH)
                {
                    brightness += 25;
                    if(brightness > max_brightness) { brightness = max_brightness; }
                    raspi_set_pwm_dutycycle(led_pin, brightness);
                    last_read_time = current_time;
                }
                if(raspi_read(decrease_btn_pin) == GPIO_HIGH)
                {
                    brightness -= 25;
                    if(brightness < 0) { brightness = 0; }
                    raspi_set_pwm_dutycycle(led_pin, brightness);
                    last_read_time = current_time;
                }
            }
        }

        close_all_windows();
        stop_timer(run_timer);
        free_all_timers();
        raspi_cleanup();
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="C#">
        ```csharp

Okay, now lets break down this code and look at its sections.

1.
    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="C++">
        ``` cpp
        int brightness = 128;
        const int max_brightness = 255;
        unsigned long last_read_time = 0;
        const unsigned long read_interval = 400;
        ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="C#">
        ```csharp
        // to-do
        ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Above is where we are setting up the variables that we're going to need. `brightness` which we are giving an inital value of 128 which is 50% of our maximum, 255. We are also setting `last_read_time` to 0 and `read_interval` to 400. We are using this to implement a simple debounce technique, in which we wait a certain amount of time (the interval) in a non-blocking manner.
2.
    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="C++">
        ``` cpp
        raspi_init();
        pins led_pin = PIN_11;
        pins increase_btn_pin = PIN_13;
        pins decrease_btn_pin = PIN_29;
        ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="C#">
        ```csharp
        // to-do
        ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Now we do our GPIO setup, where we call `raspi_init` and define the pins we are using.
3.
    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="C++">
        ``` cpp
        raspi_set_mode(led_pin, GPIO_OUTPUT);
        raspi_set_pwm_dutycycle(led_pin, brightness);

        raspi_set_mode(increase_btn_pin, GPIO_INPUT);
        raspi_set_mode(decrease_btn_pin, GPIO_INPUT);

        raspi_set_pull_up_down(increase_button_pin, PUD_DOWN);
        raspi_set_pull_up_down(decrease_btn_pin, PUD_DOWN);
        ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="C#">
        ```csharp
        // to-do
        ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Next, we setup our individual pins. We're going to write to the `led_pin` so we're setting that to output, and then we're setting its dutycycle to our initial brightness setting. Then we set our buttons to be inputs and set the pull-down resistors on them so that they are no longer floating and we can be sure they read `LOW` when not pressed.

4.
    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="C++">
        ``` cpp
        timer run_timer = create_timer("run_timer");
        start_timer(run_timer);
        unsigned long current_time = 0;

        open_window("dummy_window", 1, 1);
        while(!any_key_pressed())
        {
            process_events();
            ...
        }
        ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="C#">
        ```csharp
        // to-do
        ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    So we can debounce our buttons we'll create timers and a variable to hold the current time. Like in previous tutorials, we define how our program is going to end to ensure cleanup. In this case we are opening up our dummy window and watching for any key presses.

5.
    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="C++">
        ``` cpp
        current_time = timer_ticks(run_timer);
        if(current_time - last_read_time > read_interval)
        {
            if(raspi_read(increase_btn_pin) == GPIO_HIGH)
            {
                brightness += 25;
                if(brightness > max_brightness) { brightness = max_brightness; }
                raspi_set_pwm_dutycycle(led_pin, brightness);
                last_read_time = current_time;
            }
            if(raspi_read(decrease_btn_pin) == GPIO_HIGH)
            {
                brightness -= 25;
                if(brightness < 0) { brightness = 0; }
                raspi_set_pwm_dutycycle(led_pin, brightness);
                last_read_time = current_time;
            }
        }
        ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="C#">
        ```csharp
        // to-do
        ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Above we have the main part of the code, the inside of the while loop. At the start of every loop we are getting the current time from `timer_ticks`. We are then checking if more time has elapsed since the last button read than the interval that we set earlier.

    If this is the case, then it's time to check the buttons. We then read both buttons and if they're high then we'll either increase or decrease the brightness appropriately, set the duty cycle to this new brightness and record the last read time as the current time.
6.
    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="C++">
        ``` cpp

        close_all_windows();
        stop_timer(run_timer);
        free_all_timers();
        raspi_cleanup();
        return 0;
        ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="C#">
        ```csharp
        // to-do
        ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    As usual once our program has run we cleanup all our resources and safely exit the program.

If we run this we should see an output like the following GIF.

### Modifying PWM Range

As described in the previous tutorial, we can change the range of possible PWM values and have finer control over the brightness of the LED. In this tutorial, we use the typical PWM range of 0-255, but we could expand this to a higher resolution, like 1023, for more precise control of the exact brightness levels. Experiment with adjustments to the PWM range, modifying the parameters in your code, and observe how these changes affect the LED's response to button presses. Each step increase in the PWM range will allow for more nuanced adjustments and provide smoother transitions between light levels. Conversely, a decrease in the PWM range will limit these transitions, and make each button press cause a more noticeable change in brightness.
